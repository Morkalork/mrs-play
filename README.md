A demo project for demo purposes

## How to start developing
Run the following command once you've cloned the repository:
```
npm install
```

Voila, you've got everything you need.
After doing some of your developing you can **build** the source code with the following command:
```
gulp
```
This will create a distribution which will end up in the `dist/` folder.

## Running the stuff
Before you open up the `dist/index.html` file and run it you want to start the API, this is done with the following command:
```
node launch-server.js
```
This (and this is the surprising part) launches the server (told ya!).
